# LocalGnomes

Challenge:

Every time the heroes they play arrive at a town, they have the issue they don't know the local population and what they can do to help them on their adventures. To facilitate trade with the local population they need an easy way to browse all the inhabitants details.

Show this data in the most user-friendly way you could think. Keep in mind our heroes will be quite busy dealing with Orcs, so apps have to be really simple and easy to use. At least would be good to quickly browse (and even filter) all the individuals and be able to see the details of each one.

- Document all libraries used and explain the reason you’ve used that library.
- Test the app: add the most important test you think it is needed.
- UI must not blocked by network connections or long operations
- Images coming from network cached to improve performance
- Use third party libraries for extended functionality
- Snappiness & responsiveness over sluggishness & idleness
- Document all libraries used and explain the reason you’ve used that library.

Explanation:

1. SwiftUI over UIKit

2. No external libraries

3. Profession over name

4. Filter by name & profession

5. Access to friend's details

6. Testing
